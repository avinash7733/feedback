               <P>Student Feedback system for College in PHP(SOurce code) 
Here we have developed online feedback system, which is generally used in the college to give feedback on various fields based on the performance...Here we have 3 modules such as administrator, student , faculty.
Administrator is the one who creates the faculty account by adding all faculty info and assigning the username and password.
Students can create their account by regestering.After regestering they will get one username and password.
Admin checks the result once all students and faculty had entered the feedback..
We can start the development from the login page, where we have given the option to login as admin and student and faculty...Here since we have only one admin account, so no need to create the a database to store admin info...so the admin username is "admin" and password is "admin"...select admin in the radio button and login
You can perform all admin actions such as login to the account and check result..
If you entered the student username and password and select student option, then it will show all student information and let you enter the feedback based on the subject..
If you entered the faculty username and password and select faculty option, then it will show all faculty information and let you enter the feedback.
